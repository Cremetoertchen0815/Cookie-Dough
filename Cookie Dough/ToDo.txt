BR Ideas:
räuber und Schandan meets Packman meets Hide and seek meets 3D
-All players start in the middle, rebbels can run first, after a while barrels can roam too
-Barrels must catch all the rebbels, if all rebels are caught, the barrels win
-If the timer runs out, the rebels win
-If a rebel is being caught, he lands in prison
-Another rebel can run up to the prison and free him
