-Implement basic game stuff(freeing others, etc.)
-Implement winning
-3D sound
-Implement jump meter(???)
-Implement rejoining(or maybe not rejoining)
-Different terrain(high grass[vision is disturbed, louder noises, you can hide], water[constant sneaking speed], aerial faithplates[bounces you to a set location], )
-Implement pups(lazer[notify barrels when rebel is treading], stun[shoot at ppl]
-Music(stems, volume depends on own speed, sirens from barrels)

BR Ideas:
räuber und Schandan meets Packman meets Hide and seek meets 3D
-All players start in the middle, rebbels can run first, after a while barrels can roam too
-Barrels must catch all the rebbels, if all rebels are caught, the barrels win
-If the timer runs out, the rebels win
-If a rebel is being caught, he lands in prison
-Another rebel can run up to the prison and free him
