# Cookie-Dough
Cookie Dough is a mini-game collection, that is written is VB.NET and runs on MonoGame, making use of the 2D game development framework Nez.
This collection is meant to be included into another project of mine at a later point in time, to be exact a 2D sidescrolling platformer called "Beacon", that is currently being planned.
There are a couple of online-multiplayer compatible minigames in this collection already, one of them already being near completion.
The list of games planned to/already in the collection amounts to:

* Betreten Verboten(Lido) - near completion
* Timestein(Cowboy's checkers) - not yet begun
* Corridor(Chess) - not yet begun
* pain.(Schlafmütze) - not yet begun
* DuoCard(Uno) - under development
* DooDoo-Head(Durak) - not yet begun
* Megäaaa(Jungle Speed) - postponed indefinetely
* DropTrop(???) - polishing phase

As one can see, BV(Betreten Verboten) was the major focus and is already very close to completion(Just try it out already).
Every game mode offeres online multiplayer functionality, wacky extra-modes and original gimmicks. All being held together under one roof.
